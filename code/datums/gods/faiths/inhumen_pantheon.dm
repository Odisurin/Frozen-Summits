	name = "Faith of the Dark Covenant"
	desc = "The Faith of the Dark Covenant venerates the malevolent gods of chaos, corruption, and destruction. These evil gods thrive on suffering, domination, and the subversion of the natural order. The cult believes that true power is achieved by embracing betrayal, manipulation, and the destruction of the established norms of society. \n\
		The <b>Covenant of Shadows</b>, is the authority within this faith, that holds that the Gods Bane, Bhaal, Lolth, Myrkul, and others—represent the ultimate forces of nature, showing the world that only through fear, pain, and bloodshed can one attain true greatness. Worshippers view the world as a place to be conquered and ruled, where strength, cruelty, and deception are the only truths. To them, the world’s order must be broken to bring forth the Age of Tyranny, where the gods of darkness will reign supreme.\
		Unlike the Creed of the Eternal Circle, the Faith of the Dark Covenant rejects the cycles of balance and rebirth. It believes that only through the unrelenting force of destruction can the true path forward be paved, and those who follow these gods are willing to sacrifice all in their pursuit of dark power and domination. The Faith is known for its secretive and treacherous nature, often influencing politics, assassinations, and blood rituals to further its goals. Its followers work in the shadows, seeking to destabilize kingdoms and undermine those who stand against their dark gods."
	worshippers = "Tyrants, assassins, traitors, mercenaries, and those seeking power through violence and corruption."
